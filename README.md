# üåç Tr4pNode ‚Äì Cyberthreat Research Platform (WIP)

Tr4pNode is a lightweight, hackable, and open-source honeypot platform built for real-time cyberthreat research and visualization. Designed with modularity and education in mind, it empowers users to analyze malicious activity, experiment with DevSecOps practices, and showcase attack data in public demonstrations.

Under the hood, Tr4pNode combines Cowrie for SSH honeypot logging, MongoDB for structured data storage, and Grafana (enhanced with the Infinity plugin) for flexible dashboard-based data exploration. You can inspect session metadata through custom dashboards or watch attacks unfold live on a sleek, animated 3D globe ‚Äì turning raw intrusion logs into powerful visual insights.

## üî• What It Does?

- Captures unauthorized SSH activity via **Cowrie** and stores data in **MongoDB**
- Visualizes sessions as animated arcs between attacker and honeypot server location on a **3D globe** using **three-globe**
- Uses **Grafana dashboards** for session metadata visualization and research purposes

Offers full flexibility for research, visualization, and educational use cases

## üì° MVP Components

- Cowrie (SSH Honeypot) ‚Äì exposes fake SSH services to attract and log attackers
- MongoDB ‚Äì stores structured logs for both visualization and analytics
- Backend (Python + FastAPI) ‚Äì handles API for Grafana and WebSocket data stream for the frontend
- Frontend (React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS) ‚Äì renders the animated globe and real-time session events
- Grafana ‚Äì provides powerful dashboards using Infinity plugin connected to backend API (MongoDB data)
